# RakdamSplash
## Introduction
The purpose of this repo was getting some experience with github actions and CI pipelines. 
I originally saw a reddit post which outlined the SplashGen library, and then immediately realised it could be used for this purpose.
To showcase the pipelines the most, I've made an effort to use github pages for visuals, and then made sure to only build the html/css in the cloud.
The result of this, is a simple project that automatically rebuilds itself when changes are pushed to the Actions branch.

## Resources
[SplashGen](https://github.com/true3dco/splashgen) to generate a simple, elegant splash page.
